# Techinnover Hub Backend Engineer Coding Challenge

---

There is a major new technology that is destined to be a disruptive force in the field of transportation: **the drone**.
Just as the mobile phone allowed developing countries to leapfrog older technologies for personal communication,
the drone has the potential to leapfrog traditional transportation infrastructure.

This project is a set of REST API's that allows clients to communicate with the drones (i.e. **dispatch controller**).
The specific communication with the drone is outside the scope of this task.
